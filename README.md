# WebSiteAdvantage.KeePass.Firefox.Converter
Firefox to KeePass Password Converter plugin for KeeePass 2.x

## Notes
NuGet doesn't restore packages to the correct directory for submodules. A work-around is to create a symbolic link to this solution's `packages` directory within the solution directory of each submodule. Create junctions instead of symbolic links if git doesn't ignore the symbolic links.
